	To run & play our game follow the suggested instructions below: 	we implemented a simple web server to run our game. 
	1. Python 2.7 is a dependency and allows the simple web server to 	run. Please make sure you have 2.7 and not 3.5. 
	2. From a console or terminal navigate to “love.js/Debug” 	folder. 
	3. From here enter “python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000” to run the 	server. 
	4. From a web browser, go to localhost:800 to view the game. 

	Note: Google Chrome is not compatible, use Safari or another browser.
	Note: Give the game time to load, it may take some time. 
	Note: You can also run “http-server” if you have NodeJS and 	installed the neccessary packages. 
	Note: The game can be run using any simple static web-server as long 	as you are in the “love.js/Debug” folder
We utilized https://github.com/TannerRogalsky/love.js to help port our game to the web. If necessary take a look at their 
instructions. 
The love.js is the already packaged game and only needs to be run on a web server. 

To contribute to the game download the love.js files
